/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0024.wav,HOW MUCH OF EVIL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0025.wav,WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0026.wav,AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ALAS
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0028.wav,JACK WOULD BECOME EVA.S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0029.wav,THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0031.wav,YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0032.wav,IT IS A DUTY SAID I
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0033.wav,BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0034.wav,NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TREBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0035.wav,THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVERBEND SAID SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0037.wav,YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0038.wav,THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0039.wav,I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOARD
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0040.wav,THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT HE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0041.wav,THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0042.wav,YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINANDO BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLEAX
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0043.wav,BUT WHAT IS THE DELICATE MISSION I ASKED
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0044.wav,I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0047.wav,YOU PROPOSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0048.wav,WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0049.wav,LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES IS A VERY GALLANT OFFICER
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0050.wav,ONE OF US ALWAYS REMAINS ON BOARD WHILE THE OTHER IS ON SHORE
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0052.wav,YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0053.wav,WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0054.wav,THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0055.wav,SIR I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITANNULA
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0056.wav,THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCY.S KNOWLEDGE
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0058.wav,IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0059.wav,BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNMENT
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0060.wav,THE JOHN BRIGHT IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANNULA SHOULD PREVAIL
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0062.wav,WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE JOHN BRIGHT SHALL START
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0063.wav,TO DAY I SHOUTED
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0064.wav,AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0065.wav,I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FERDINANDO
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0066.wav,THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE ALTERED
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0067.wav,OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0068.wav,YOUR POWER IS SUFFICIENT I SAID
/Libri_data/test_data/8455/210777/8455-210777-0070.wav,AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0001.wav,THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0004.wav,IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0005.wav,UNDER THE TABU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0008.wav,THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0012.wav,THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND GRADES
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0013.wav,THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0015.wav,SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0017.wav,THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0018.wav,THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0019.wav,BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5694/3570-5694-0022.wav,THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0000.wav,IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0002.wav,BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0003.wav,IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0006.wav,VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0008.wav,THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0009.wav,EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0010.wav,THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5695/3570-5695-0013.wav,CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5696/3570-5696-0002.wav,OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5696/3570-5696-0004.wav,THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5696/3570-5696-0006.wav,AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5696/3570-5696-0008.wav,BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
/Libri_data/test_data/3570/5696/3570-5696-0010.wav,AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0000.wav,AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0001.wav,WHY ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER.S SOCIETY
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0002.wav,WHY ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0003.wav,SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0004.wav,WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGION
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0005.wav,SHE A TORY AND CLERGYMAN.S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DISSENT AND RADICALISM
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0006.wav,HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0007.wav,HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0009.wav,JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SOUTHEY
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0010.wav,I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0011.wav,BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0012.wav,YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0013.wav,THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0014.wav,TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY

/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0021.wav,I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0022.wav,IN THE EVENINGS I CONFESS I DO THINK BUT I NEVER TROUBLE ANY ONE ELSE WITH MY THOUGHTS
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0023.wav,I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ECCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0027.wav,I CANNOT DENY MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION OF INSERTING SOUTHEY.S REPLY

/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0034.wav,IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0035.wav,I WISH IT WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0040.wav,INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0045.wav,I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0047.wav,TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0048.wav,HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0049.wav,THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0050.wav,TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0051.wav,AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0052.wav,SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0054.wav,STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE.S STATE OF HEALTH
/Libri_data/test_data/3575/170457/3575-170457-0056.wav,I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0001.wav,THE INFLUENCE WITH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0004.wav,THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0005.wav,IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0007.wav,BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0009.wav,THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0012.wav,MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0013.wav,IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0014.wav,THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0015.wav,THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0016.wav,BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0017.wav,NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0018.wav,BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0020.wav,AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/960/2961-960-0022.wav,PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0000.wav,SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0001.wav,AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0003.wav,I WILL IF TIMAEUS APPROVES I APPROVE
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0004.wav,LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SOLON.S WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROPIDAS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0005.wav,SOME POEMS OF SOLON WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0006.wav,AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0007.wav,THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0008.wav,BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAS PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
/Libri_data/test_data/2961/961/2961-961-0009.wav,TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SOLON HEARD THE STORY

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0005.wav,DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0009.wav,PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0010.wav,EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0011.wav,PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0012.wav,THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0013.wav,HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0014.wav,THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0016.wav,IT SPOILS ONE.S BEST WORK
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0017.wav,WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0018.wav,I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0019.wav,I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0020.wav,THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0028.wav,THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0029.wav,ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0030.wav,THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0035.wav,THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN.S OPINION
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0036.wav,WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0037.wav,SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0045.wav,MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0046.wav,WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0047.wav,TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0049.wav,EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0050.wav,DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0051.wav,WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0052.wav,WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0053.wav,AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0055.wav,TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0056.wav,OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0057.wav,THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0062.wav,NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0063.wav,UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES

/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0065.wav,PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0066.wav,SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0067.wav,THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0068.wav,THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0069.wav,THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0070.wav,BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0071.wav,WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS SIN
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0072.wav,THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0074.wav,THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0075.wav,BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
/Libri_data/test_data/2830/3980/2830-3980-0076.wav,ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79740/7021-79740-0001.wav,DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE

/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79730/7021-79730-0000.wav,THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79730/7021-79730-0001.wav,TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79730/7021-79730-0002.wav,BY REASON AND AFFECTION
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79730/7021-79730-0005.wav,SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON.T YOU
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79730/7021-79730-0006.wav,THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79730/7021-79730-0008.wav,BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0000.wav,BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0001.wav,HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS

/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0004.wav,YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0005.wav,SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0006.wav,I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERS
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0008.wav,FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0009.wav,AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0010.wav,ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0011.wav,THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE

/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0014.wav,HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0015.wav,WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0016.wav,THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0017.wav,SO IT IS SAID ANDERS
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0018.wav,AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER.S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0019.wav,WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0020.wav,HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0021.wav,HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER.S COTTAGE
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0022.wav,AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0023.wav,BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING.S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0024.wav,ANDERS FACE GREW RED
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/85628/7021-85628-0025.wav,BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE

/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79759/7021-79759-0001.wav,THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79759/7021-79759-0002.wav,THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
/Libri_data/test_data/7021/79759/7021-79759-0003.wav,VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
/Libri_data/test_data/5683/32866/5683-32866-0000.wav,MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
/Libri_data/test_data/5683/32866/5683-32866-0001.wav,AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
/Libri_data/test_data/5683/32866/5683-32866-0002.wav,BUT DON.T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY

/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0022.wav,I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0023.wav,MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0024.wav,I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0025.wav,IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0026.wav,YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYAL IS THE MOST EXACT
/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0027.wav,THAT IS TRUE BADAUDERIE
/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0028.wav,ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED

/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0039.wav,HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
/Libri_data/test_data/3729/6852/3729-6852-0040.wav,FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS

/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0000.wav,THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0003.wav,AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0005.wav,ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0006.wav,THE BEHAVIOURIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0008.wav,BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0011.wav,SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0012.wav,FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0014.wav,I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0015.wav,THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0016.wav,IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0017.wav,THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0020.wav,IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.wav,REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0022.wav,SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0023.wav,IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.wav,THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.wav,THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0029.wav,THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0030.wav,SEMON.S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0032.wav,IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.wav,THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0036.wav,A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
/Libri_data/test_data/8230/279154/8230-279154-0039.wav,THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
