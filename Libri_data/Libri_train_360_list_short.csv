/Libri_data/train_data_360/8028/233382/8028-233382-0008.wav,A COMMON METHOD IS TO STOP FOR AWHILE IN SOME TOWN AND GAIN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SLUM CHILDREN

/Libri_data/train_data_360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0020.wav,WHERE THERE WERE ALMOST NO CHILDREN OF HIS OWN AGE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0021.wav,FROM THIS TIME UNTIL THE CHANGES OF PUBERTY WERE WELL UNDER WAY HIS SEXUAL LIFE CONTRASTED STRONGLY IN ITS SOLITUDE WITH THE FORMER PROMISCUITY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0026.wav,JUST THEN CERTAIN NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENTS FELL UNDER HIS EYE AND THESE PERSUADED HIM THAT HE HAD PRODUCED IN HIMSELF A DISEASED CONDITION
/Libri_data/train_data_360/8028/233366/8028-233366-0032.wav,ENJOYING INTERCRURAL INTERCOURSE AND SOMETIMES MUTUAL MASTURBATION THEIR PARENTS MAY HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY UNEASY AT TIMES

/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0001.wav,THE NONEXISTENCE OF EVIL THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF THIS SUBJECT IS VERY DIFFICULT KNOW THAT BEINGS ARE OF TWO KINDS MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0002.wav,THOSE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES AND THOSE INTELLECTUAL THINGS WHICH ARE SENSIBLE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE PERCEIVED BY THE FIVE EXTERIOR SENSES THUS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0004.wav,FOR EXAMPLE MIND ITSELF IS AN INTELLECTUAL THING WHICH HAS NO OUTWARD EXISTENCE ALL MAN'S CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITIES FORM AN INTELLECTUAL EXISTENCE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0005.wav,EVIL IS SIMPLY THEIR NONEXISTENCE SO IGNORANCE IS THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE ERROR IS THE WANT OF GUIDANCE FORGETFULNESS IS THE WANT OF MEMORY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0006.wav,STUPIDITY IS THE WANT OF GOOD SENSE ALL THESE THINGS HAVE NO REAL EXISTENCE IN THE SAME WAY THE SENSIBLE REALITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY GOOD
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0008.wav,DEATH IS THE WANT OF LIFE AND WEAKNESS IS THE WANT OF STRENGTH NEVERTHELESS A DOUBT OCCURS TO THE MIND THAT IS SCORPIONS AND SERPENTS ARE POISONOUS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0009.wav,ARE THEY GOOD OR EVIL FOR THEY ARE EXISTING BEINGS YES A SCORPION IS EVIL IN RELATION TO MAN A SERPENT IS EVIL IN RELATION TO MAN
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0010.wav,BUT IN RELATION TO THEMSELVES THEY ARE NOT EVIL FOR THEIR POISON IS THEIR WEAPON AND BY THEIR STING THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0013.wav,HE CREATED GOOD THIS EVIL IS NOTHINGNESS SO DEATH IS THE ABSENCE OF LIFE WHEN MAN NO LONGER RECEIVES LIFE HE DIES DARKNESS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0014.wav,IS THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT WHEN THERE IS NO LIGHT THERE IS DARKNESS LIGHT IS AN EXISTING THING BUT DARKNESS IS NONEXISTENT WEALTH IS AN EXISTING THING
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0015.wav,BUT POVERTY IS NONEXISTING THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL EVILS RETURN TO NONEXISTENCE GOOD EXISTS EVIL IS NONEXISTENT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0016.wav,KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF TORMENT SUBTILE AND GROSS FOR EXAMPLE IGNORANCE ITSELF IS A TORMENT BUT IT IS A SUBTILE TORMENT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0017.wav,INDIFFERENCE TO GOD IS ITSELF A TORMENT SO ALSO ARE FALSEHOOD CRUELTY AND TREACHERY ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS ARE TORMENTS BUT THEY ARE SUBTILE TORMENTS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0019.wav,IMPRISONMENT BEATING EXPULSION AND BANISHMENT BUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD SEPARATION FROM GOD IS THE GREATEST TORMENT OF ALL
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0020.wav,THE JUSTICE AND MERCY OF GOD KNOW THAT TO DO JUSTICE IS TO GIVE TO EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS DESERTS FOR EXAMPLE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0022.wav,IS BOUNTY IF YOU GIVE ALMS AND GIFTS TO A POOR MAN ALTHOUGH HE HAS TAKEN NO TROUBLE FOR YOU NOR DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT THIS IS BOUNTY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0024.wav,REGARD THEM AS MATTERS OF LAW NOT OF REASON THUS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0025.wav,THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL TO PARTAKE OF MEAT AND BUTTER TOGETHER BECAUSE IT IS TAREF AND TAREF IN HEBREW MEANS UNCLEAN AS KOSHER MEANS CLEAN THIS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0026.wav,THEY SAY IS A QUESTION OF LAW AND NOT OF REASON BUT THE THEOLOGIANS THINK THAT THE GOOD AND EVIL OF THINGS DEPEND UPON BOTH REASON AND LAW
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0027.wav,TREACHERY FALSEHOOD HYPOCRISY AND CRUELTY IS REASON EVERY INTELLIGENT MAN COMPREHENDS THAT MURDER THEFT TREACHERY FALSEHOOD HYPOCRISY AND CRUELTY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0028.wav,ACCORDING TO REASON IS EVIL AND REPREHENSIBLE IF HE COMMITS A MURDER HE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE WHETHER THE RENOWN OF THE PROPHET HAS REACHED HIM OR NOT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0029.wav,FOR IT IS REASON THAT FORMULATES THE REPREHENSIBLE CHARACTER OF THE ACTION WHEN A MAN COMMITS THIS BAD ACTION HE WILL SURELY BE RESPONSIBLE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0034.wav,WILL THIS BE A BALM FOR HIS WOUND OR A REMEDY FOR HIS PAIN NO GOD FORBID IN TRUTH THE TWO ACTIONS ARE THE SAME BOTH ARE INJURIES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0035.wav,THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE OCCURRED FIRST
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0036.wav,THE LAW OF THE COMMUNITY WILL PUNISH THE AGGRESSOR BUT WILL NOT TAKE REVENGE THIS PUNISHMENT HAS FOR ITS END TO WARN TO PROTECT AND TO OPPOSE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220979/7515-220979-0037.wav,CRUELTY AND TRANSGRESSION SO THAT OTHER MEN MAY NOT BE TYRANNICAL BUT IF HE WHO HAS BEEN STRUCK PARDONS AND FORGIVES HE SHOWS THE GREATEST MERCY

/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0002.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHY PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HE WALKS ABOUT THE TEMPLE IN A TOP HAT SO MANY OF ONE'S ACQUAINTANCES AT SOME TIME OR OTHER HAVE EATEN DINNERS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0004.wav,GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY OBSERVE THIS WELL DRESSED GENTLEMAN BEFORE YOU WHAT SHALL WE SAY ABOUT HIM LET US BEGIN BY ASKING OURSELVES WHAT WE EXPECT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0005.wav,FROM A PROFESSION IN THE FIRST PLACE CERTAINLY WE EXPECT A LIVING BUT I THINK WE WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0006.wav,IF WE WERE OFFERED A THOUSAND A YEAR TO WALK FROM CHARING CROSS TO BARNET EVERY DAY REASONS OF POVERTY MIGHT COMPEL US TO ACCEPT THE OFFER
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0010.wav,HE WOULD HAVE TO PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS WALKING NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT ALSO FOR THE COMMUNITY IT SEEMS TO ME THEN
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0013.wav,IS GIVING A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD EXPRESSING THE TRUTH AS HE SEES IT FOR HIS OWN PROFIT PERHAPS BUT NOT FOR THAT ALONE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0014.wav,ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS OF LIVING HAVE SOMETHING OF NOBILITY IN THEM WE ENTER THEM FULL OF HIGH RESOLVES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0015.wav,WE FAIL OF COURSE THE PAINTER FINDS THAT MOTHER'S DARLING BRINGS IN THE STUFF AND HE TURNS OUT MOTHER'S DARLINGS MECHANICALLY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0016.wav,BUT IT IS NOT BECAUSE THE PROFESSION IS AN IGNOBLE ONE WE HAD OUR CHANCES INDEED THE LIGHT IS STILL THERE FOR THOSE WHO LOOK IT BECKONS TO US
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0017.wav,NOW WHAT OF THE BAR IS THE BARRISTER AFTER ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIS OWN ADVANCEMENT HE FOLLOWS WHAT GLEAM WHAT ARE HIS IDEALS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0024.wav,BUT ONLY ABOUT HIS OWN VICTORY WHAT ULTIMATELY THEN IS HE AFTER WHAT DOES THE BAR OFFER ITS DEVOTEES BEYOND MATERIAL SUCCESS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0025.wav,I ASKED JUST NOW WHAT WERE A BARRISTER'S IDEALS SUPPOSE WE ASK INSTEAD WHAT IS THE IDEAL BARRISTER IF ONE SPOKE LOOSELY OF AN IDEAL DOCTOR
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0027.wav,BUT CAN THERE BE AN IDEAL BARRISTER OTHER THAN A SUCCESSFUL BARRISTER THE EAGER YOUNG WRITER JUST BEGINNING A LITERARY CAREER MIGHT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0031.wav,WITHOUT GETTING SOMEBODY TO SWEEP THEM BUT THAT WOULD NOT DISQUALIFY ME FROM SAYING THAT ROAD SWEEPING WAS AN UNATTRACTIVE PROFESSION
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/100431/7515-100431-0032.wav,SO ALSO I AM ENTITLED TO MY OPINION ABOUT THE BAR WHICH IS THIS THAT BECAUSE IT OFFERS MATERIAL VICTORIES ONLY AND NEVER SPIRITUAL ONES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220980/7515-220980-0000.wav,THE RIGHT METHOD OF TREATING CRIMINALS QUESTION SHOULD A CRIMINAL BE PUNISHED

/Libri_data/train_data_360/7515/220980/7515-220980-0012.wav,THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT ONE WAS COMMITTED FIRST THE OTHER LATER BUT THE COMMUNITY HAS THE RIGHT OF DEFENSE AND OF SELF PROTECTION MOREOVER

/Libri_data/train_data_360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0045.wav,I'VE NOTHING FOR YOU NOTHING FOR YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF THE GREEN MAN QUIETLY REFILLED HIS PIPE LIT IT BOWED TO US AND WENT OUT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0048.wav,ROULETABILLE RETURNED TOWARDS THE FIREPLACE AND SAID NOW WE'LL GRILL OUR STEAK
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0053.wav,FOLLOWED BY ME TOWARDS THE LITTLE BUILDING WHICH STANDING NEAR THE PARK GATE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0055.wav,SIGNIFIED MANY THINGS WE WERE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROAD LEADING TO THE CHATEAU WHEN A CONSIDERABLE STIR AT THE PARK GATE ATTRACTED OUR ATTENTION
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0056.wav,AND WHETHER HE IS SO MUCH CLEVERER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3008/164328/3008-164328-0057.wav,WHO WERE ALSO DESIROUS OF ENTERING THE PARK BUT TWO GENDARMES STATIONED AT THE GATE HAD EVIDENTLY RECEIVED ORDERS TO REFUSE ADMISSION TO ANYBODY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/138486/1571-138486-0005.wav,IT IS A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN THIS COPY ALMOST THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE BILL CAN BE READ IN SPITE OF CANCELLATIONS AND INTERLINEATIONS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/138486/1571-138486-0027.wav,HAD THE BILL BECOME LAW THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE KINGDOM WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE NECESSITY OF SIGNING THE ARTICLES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/138486/1571-138486-0030.wav,THE TRUTH IS THAT THE TIME FOR SUCH A SCHEME HAD GONE BY IF A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER WHEN THE DIVISION IN THE PROTESTANT BODY WAS RECENT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/141320/1571-141320-0002.wav,I HEARD A SLOW SCRAPE OF HIS CHAIR LEGS ON THE UNCARPETED FLOOR AND SOON HE APPEARED STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE OF HIS HERMITAGE WHAT IS WANTED
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/141320/1571-141320-0005.wav,EVERY COPYIST IS BOUND TO HELP EXAMINE HIS COPY IS IT NOT SO WILL YOU NOT SPEAK ANSWER I PREFER NOT TO HE REPLIED IN A FLUTE LIKE TONE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/141320/1571-141320-0023.wav,BARTLEBY SAID I WHEN THOSE PAPERS ARE ALL COPIED I WILL COMPARE THEM WITH YOU I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HOW
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/141320/1571-141320-0047.wav,BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY TWINGES OF IMPOTENT REBELLION AGAINST THE MILD EFFRONTERY OF THIS UNACCOUNTABLE SCRIVENER
/Libri_data/train_data_360/1571/141320/1571-141320-0051.wav,I LOOKED ROUND ANXIOUSLY PEEPED BEHIND HIS SCREEN
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0001.wav,THEN THIS LAW REQUIRED SOME INTEREST EITHER BY WAY OF ATTRACTION OR CONSTRAINT SINCE IT DID NOT ORIGINATE AS A LAW FROM HIS OWN WILL
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0007.wav,WHILE GIVING LAWS HE IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF ANY OTHER A RATIONAL BEING MUST ALWAYS REGARD HIMSELF AS GIVING LAWS EITHER AS MEMBER
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0017.wav,THEY EXHIBIT THE WILL THAT PERFORMS THEM AS AN OBJECT OF AN IMMEDIATE RESPECT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0025.wav,AND THEREFORE AN END IN ITSELF MUST IN EVERY MAXIM SERVE AS THE CONDITION LIMITING ALL MERELY RELATIVE AND ARBITRARY ENDS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0036.wav,THE END MUST BE CONCEIVED NOT AS AN END TO BE EFFECTED BUT AS AN INDEPENDENTLY EXISTING END CONSEQUENTLY IT IS CONCEIVED ONLY NEGATIVELY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0039.wav,BY THE CONDITION OF ITS HOLDING GOOD AS A LAW FOR EVERY SUBJECT THIS COMES TO THE SAME THING AS THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF ALL MAXIMS OF ACTION
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0047.wav,AND IT IS JUST IN THIS THAT THE PARADOX LIES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0075.wav,FOR ONE OF THESE THEORIES BECAUSE THEIR HEARERS WOULD NOT TOLERATE SUSPENSION OF JUDGEMENT BUT WHAT INTERESTS US MORE HERE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0084.wav,AND THAT AS AUTONOMY THAT IS TO SAY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0085.wav,IS ITSELF THE ONLY LAW WHICH THE WILL OF EVERY RATIONAL BEING IMPOSES ON ITSELF WITHOUT NEEDING TO ASSUME ANY SPRING OR INTEREST AS A FOUNDATION
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0087.wav,THIS SUPPOSES THE POSSIBILITY OF A SYNTHETIC USE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/398/6555-398-0088.wav,WHICH HOWEVER WE CANNOT VENTURE ON WITHOUT FIRST GIVING A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THIS FACULTY OF REASON
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0006.wav,THE DIFFICULTY OF DISCERNING ITS POSSIBILITY IS A VERY PROFOUND ONE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0007.wav,I CONNECT THE ACT WITH THE WILL WITHOUT PRESUPPOSING ANY CONDITION RESULTING FROM ANY INCLINATION
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0008.wav,AND THEREFORE NECESSARILY THOUGH ONLY OBJECTIVELY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0011.wav,FOR EVEN IF WE KNOW THE TENOR OF SUCH AN ABSOLUTE COMMAND
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0014.wav,THAT THE MAXIM OF THE ACTION SHOULD CONFORM TO A UNIVERSAL LAW AND IT IS THIS CONFORMITY ALONE THAT THE IMPERATIVE PROPERLY REPRESENTS AS NECESSARY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0016.wav,THAT MAXIM CANNOT POSSIBLY EXIST AS A UNIVERSAL LAW OF NATURE AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD BE WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF ALL DUTY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0017.wav,NOW THIS PRINCIPLE OF SELF LOVE OR OF ONE'S OWN ADVANTAGE MAY PERHAPS BE CONSISTENT WITH MY WHOLE FUTURE WELFARE BUT THE QUESTION NOW IS IS IT RIGHT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0022.wav,HE SEES THEN THAT A SYSTEM OF NATURE COULD INDEED SUBSIST WITH SUCH A UNIVERSAL LAW ALTHOUGH MEN
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6555/397/6555-397-0023.wav,SHOULD LET THEIR TALENTS REST AND RESOLVE TO DEVOTE THEIR LIVES MERELY TO IDLENESS AMUSEMENT AND PROPAGATION OF THEIR SPECIES IN A WORD TO ENJOYMENT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0021.wav,HAVING ABOUT HIM SOME TRUE ESSENCE OF THE TEARS OF THE VALLEY OF TRIBULATION ALAS HER SISTER'S TASTE WAS QUITE OF ANOTHER KIND
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0022.wav,SAID MISSUS RAY AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM NO MOTHER I DIDN'T THINK THAT BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE STAYING LATE WITH MISSUS STURT SO WE WERE AND REALLY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0027.wav,BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO THINK AS WELL OF YOUR BROTHER IN LAW AS POSSIBLE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0036.wav,RACHEL NOW SHARED HER MOTHER'S ROOM
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0041.wav,SHE HAS BEHAVED BEST THROUGH IT ALL
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0042.wav,THAT NIGHT AND I ALMOST DOUBT WHETHER RACHEL SLEPT AT ALL IT SEEMED TO HER THAT IN THE PRESENT CONDITION OF HER LIFE SLEEP COULD HARDLY BE NECESSARY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0049.wav,BUT I THINK THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH FEAR SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE COULD AFFORD TO BE TRANQUIL IN HER HAPPINESS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0051.wav,BUT THE DURATION OF THEIR MEAL WAS TERRIBLY LONG
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0053.wav,NOW HE WAS THERE ON PURPOSE TO TAKE HER WITH HIM AND SHE WENT FORTH WITH HIM LEANING LOVINGLY ON HIS ARM WHILE YET CLOSE UNDER HER SISTER'S EYES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0061.wav,SHE HAS HAD A SAD TIME OF IT DOROTHEA SINCE WE MADE HER WRITE THAT LETTER TO HIM A VERY SAD TIME OF IT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0065.wav,THOUGH I DON'T SUPPOSE IT WILL THE LEAST IN THE WORLD BUT IF IT WOULD SHE MAY KNOW THAT I THINK SHE HAS DONE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0067.wav,NOW THAT SHE IS TO BE SETTLED IN LIFE AS A MARRIED WOMAN
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0071.wav,AUGUSTA WOULD HAVE TURNED BOLDLY AWAY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0072.wav,BUT TO THIS BOTH MARTHA AND CHERRY OBJECTED WE HAVE HEARD OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT SAID MARTHA AND WE CONGRATULATE YOU
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/62347/6215-62347-0073.wav,YES SAID AUGUSTA THE PLACE ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE AND SO WE THINK IT BEST TO GO
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/68888/6215-68888-0017.wav,I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW A WORLD COULD BE BEAUTIFUL WHERE THERE WAS NO MORE SEA
/Libri_data/train_data_360/6215/68888/6215-68888-0031.wav,IT SEEMED LIKE A LOVELY STORY THE LOVELIEST IN THE WORLD
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168204/3224-168204-0002.wav,HEREUPON THEY DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL SENTIMENTS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168204/3224-168204-0008.wav,BEING DETERRED BY THE MULTITUDES OF SPANIARDS GATHERED ON ALL SIDES TO FALL UPON THEM WHEREOF THEY HAD TIMELY ADVICE

/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168204/3224-168204-0017.wav,WHO WERE TAKEN IN THAT ENCOUNTER BY THOSE INDIANS WERE AS THEIR CRUEL CAPTAIN TORN IN PIECES AND BURNT ALIVE THUS ENDS THE HISTORY THE LIFE

/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168204/3224-168204-0021.wav,WHEREIN THEY HAD LIVED TEN ENTIRE MONTHS THESE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOW CONSIDERABLY STRENGTHENED TO EFFECT WITH GREATER SATISFACTION THEIR DESIGNS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168204/3224-168204-0025.wav,BUT ALL IN VAIN FOR HAVING RANGED UP AND DOWN THE WOODS FOR SOME DAYS WITHOUT FINDING THE LEAST COMFORT THEY WERE FORCED TO RETURN TO THE RIVER
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168204/3224-168204-0026.wav,THE SHEATHS OF THEIR SWORDS KNIVES AND OTHER SUCH THINGS BEING ALMOST RAVENOUS AND EAGER TO MEET SOME INDIANS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168199/3224-168199-0000.wav,HIS OWN NAME NOT BEING KNOWN
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3224/168199/3224-168199-0006.wav,HERE THEY GOT ASHORE IN A CANOE AND MARCHING ALONG THE COAST WITH ALL THE SPEED THEY COULD

/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0049.wav,IN GREATER NUMBER THAN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0051.wav,SINCE INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0053.wav,MAY BE TERMINATED IN THEM AND HENCE THE SAME CONCLUSION IS TO BE DRAWN AS BEFORE ON THE CONTRARY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0054.wav,MINISTERED TO HIM AND TEN THOUSANDS TIMES A HUNDRED THOUSAND STOOD BEFORE HIM I ANSWER THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS OPINIONS WITH REGARD TO THE NUMBER
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0056.wav,IT WOULD HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE SEPARATE SUBSTANCES IS THE NUMBER
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0058.wav,EXIST IN EXCEEDING GREAT NUMBER FAR BEYOND ALL MATERIAL MULTITUDE THIS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0062.wav,IN THE ANGELS NUMBER IS NOT THAT OF DISCRETE QUANTITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVISION OF WHAT IS CONTINUOUS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0063.wav,HE WAS FORCED TO MAKE USE OF THIS ARGUMENT SINCE ONLY THROUGH SENSIBLE THINGS CAN WE COME TO KNOW
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0064.wav,NAMELY AS ONE IS SIMPLER THAN ANOTHER AND OF KEENER INTELLECT THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT DIFFER SPECIFICALLY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0065.wav,THE MORE OUGHT IT TO BE MULTIPLIED BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE SO IF THERE WERE BUT ONE INDIVIDUAL UNDER ONE SPECIES
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0068.wav,BUT ARE DISTINGUISHED MATERIALLY IF THEREFORE THE ANGELS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0074.wav,TO THE DIVERSE DEGREES OF INTELLECTUAL NATURE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0076.wav,IS MORE PERFECT THAN AIR AND IN THIS WAY THE ANGELS ARE DIVERSIFIED ACCORDING TO MORE OR LESS REPLY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0078.wav,TO BE THE ANGELS THEREFORE THE ANGELS ARE CORRUPTIBLE BY THEIR NATURE
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0085.wav,CEASES TO BE ACTUALLY WHEN THE FORM IS SEPARATED FROM THE MATTER BUT IF THE FORM SUBSISTS IN ITS OWN BEING AS HAPPENS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10327/3009-10327-0088.wav,BEING ABOVE TIME IS EVERLASTING HENCE EVERY INTELLECTUAL SUBSTANCE IS INCORRUPTIBLE OF ITS OWN NATURE

/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0000.wav,IT WOULD SEEM THAT ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM

/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0003.wav,IS AKIN TO THAT OF AERIAL BODIES BUT THE NATURE OF DEMONS AND ANGELS IS THE SAME THEREFORE ANGELS HAVE BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0004.wav,INCORPOREAL I ANSWER THAT THE ANGELS HAVE NOT BODIES NATURALLY UNITED TO THEM FOR WHATEVER BELONGS TO ANY NATURE AS AN ACCIDENT
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0007.wav,NOT AS ASSERTING THE FACT BUT MERELY USING THE OPINION OF THE PLATONISTS WHO MAINTAINED THAT THERE ARE SOME AERIAL ANIMALS WHICH THEY TERMED DEMONS
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0008.wav,BECAUSE AN ANGEL HAS NO NEED FOR A BODY SINCE HIS OWN POWER EXCEEDS ALL BODILY POWER THEREFORE AN ANGEL DOES NOT ASSUME A BODY
/Libri_data/train_data_360/3009/10328/3009-10328-0011.wav,THEREFORE THE ANGELS DO NOT ASSUME BODIES ON THE CONTRARY AUGUSTINE SAYS
